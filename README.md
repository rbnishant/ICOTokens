# Steps to run scripts:

1. Create a file with name `privKey` and add the seed words of the ethereum account in it. This address will become the owner address of the airdrop contract.

2. Run command `npm install`.

3. Add ethereum addresses and token amount in the file `airdrop.csv`(scripts->data->airdrop.csv). This file contains those addresses to which owner wants to send tokens.

4. Add ethereum addresses and token amount in the file `whitelist.csv`(scripts->data->airdrop.csv). All the addresses of this file will get whitelisted and whitelisted addresses can claim there tokens from myetherwallet.

5. Change the `token address(tokenAddress)` in the `2_deploy_contracts.js`(migrations->2_deploy_contracts.js) file. This address will be used to set the token address in the airdrop contract.

6. Run command `npm run compile`. This command will compile the airdrop contract.

7. Run command `npm run migrate-mainnet`. This command will deploy the airdrop contract to the mainnet and you will get the airdrop contract address in the console.

8. After contract migration you have to transfer tokens to the airdrop contract address as tokens will be distributed from that contract. If tokens won't be there in contract the transctions would get failed.

9. After token transfer you need to run the scripts. Run command `node scripts/csv_allocation.js 70 1 18` in this `70` is the batch size `1` refers to the mainnet ethereum network and `18` is decimal. This script will transfer the tokens to the addresses which is set in the airdrop.csv file.

10. Run command `node scripts/whitelist.js 70 1 18` in this `70` is the batch size `1` refers to the mainnet ethereum network and `18` is decimal. This script will whitelist addresses with desired tokens.
